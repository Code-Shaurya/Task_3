# Task 3: Linear Regression

In this task, we implemented both simple and multiple linear regression using the Housing dataset.

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

### Workflow
1. Loaded and preprocessed the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Built a linear regression model using `LinearRegression` from Scikit-learn.
4. Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² metrics.
5. Visualized the regression line for simple regression and interpreted model coefficients.

This helped in understanding the linear relationship between independent features and house prices.
